# (Smart) File Renamer

A Python script that renames files in a directory based on naming conventions and entity recognition using NLP.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download spaCy Model

This script uses `en_core_web_trf`, a transformer-based spaCy model. Install it with:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
```

### 3. Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python smart_rename.py
